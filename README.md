# yt-dlp-gui
yt-dlp-gui is a simple GUI program that makes using yt-dlp for people not familiar with the terminal/command prompt. (made for Windows)

# Why this project?
You might ask: "There are already a lot of yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers out there, so why make another one?"

I made it because of a few reasons:
1. I wanted to make this to extend my C# knowledge
2. Many of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers are dead/unmaintained
3. A lot of the youtube-dl gui wrappers don't use yt-dlp so they are missing features from yt-dlp (SponSkrub, in my experience yt-dlp breaks less, etc)
4. Some of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers use Electron (high memory usage, etc) or a web application

I will be adding more features soon, you can see the progress [here](https://github.com/SKBotNL/yt-dlp-gui/projects/1).
