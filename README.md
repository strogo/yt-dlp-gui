# yt-dlp-gui
A little python script to make using yt-dlp easier (made for Windows)
# Why this project?
You might ask, why did I make this project? There are already a lot of yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers out there.
I made it because of a few reasons:
1. I wanted to make this to extend my Python knowledge
2. Many of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers are dead/unmaintained
3. A lot of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers did not have a simple interface
And I want to kinda balance yt-dlp-gui between simpicity and functionality, and I will be adding more features soon.
