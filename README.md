# yt-dlp-gui
yt-dlp-gui is a simple GUI program that makes using yt-dlp for people not familiar with the terminal/the command prompt. (made for Windows)

# Why this project?
You might ask, why did I make this project? There are already a lot of yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers out there.
I made it because of a few reasons:
1. I wanted to make this to extend my Python knowledge
2. Many of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers are dead/unmaintained
3. A lot of the yt-dlp/youtube-dl gui wrappers did not have a simple interface and I want to kinda balance yt-dlp-gui between simpicity and functionality

I will be adding more features soon.
